I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2023 from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/) at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Liang Hu](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19276.htm). Additionally, I was also guided by Prof. [Wanfu Gao](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1028/19117.htm). I am also a member of [CCCI Group](https://ccci.swufe.edu.cn/) ([认知计算与群智协同创新团队](https://ccci.swufe.edu.cn/)), which is led by Prof. [Xin Yang](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/info/1119/2300.htm) ([杨新](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/info/1119/2300.htm)).

Research
======
The long-term research goal of our team is to develop robust and trustworthy machine learning methods for complex, high-dimensional and distributed data environments. Most recently, our research focuses on **machine learning and its applications in data mining**, following are some related research problems:

- **How to select informative and non-redundant features from high-dimensional data?**
  - Related Topics: Feature Selection, (Partial) Multi-label Learning, etc.

- **How to uncover and leverage causal relationships in observational data?**
  - Related Topics: Causal Inference, Causal Discovery, Information-Theoretic Methods, etc.

- **How to collaboratively train models across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy?**
  - Related Topics: Federated Learning, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, etc.

- **How to enable models to continually learn from non-stationary data without catastrophic forgetting?**
  - Related Topics: Continual Learning, Lifelong Learning, Incremental Learning, etc.
